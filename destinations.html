        <h2 class="destinations__h2" >Ubud</h2>
        <p class="main__descr" >Ubud is a town in the center of the island Bali. It's known that it's surrounded by rice fields and forests where it's time for mindfulness. My best friend and I traveled from Canggu to Ubud to visit the monkey temple and the rice fields. We booked a driver, his name is Gede and we left the house early in the morning and arrived two hours later, because there was a little trafic. We had a great full day pf activities ahead of us, first we went to visit a temple, then we saw the beautiful rice fields and the big swings, but unfortunately is was raining so we didn't try the swings and just enjoyed some drinks under the terrace, while looking over our beautiful view of the rice terrases. After that we had some delicious lunch at Bebek Tapi Sawah. The meal has energized us to do our last round of activities which was visitid our beloved monkeys at the jungle :D. They were extremely cute and we headed towards our villa home again. On our way home our driver suggested we go visit the waterfall and we did and it was a great idea. The sun has set and we paved our way in the darkness into the slippery rocks that's located at the bottom of the waterfall. You can find a picture of us in the gallery, and that was our last acitiity in Ubud before heading to our nice villa in Canggu.</p>

        <h2 class="destinations__h2" >Canggu</h2>
        <p class="main__descr" >Canggu is a village near the coast. This is the place where you live. This place is surrounded by expats and expensive vegan bohemian food spots you could say, but an amazing place to stay at where everything is just around the corner and have the most amazing vibe with lots of friendly people. From morning bakerys, bakso's around every doorstep to very expersive beachclubs that goes from 100 euros a bed, but it's all worth it at the end and still cheaper than in Europe!</p>

        <h2 class="destinations__h2">Uluwatu</h2>
        <p class="main__descr" >Ulutwatu! An amazing place to actually enjoy the beautiful view and enjoy the culture privately. It's on a cliff and quite far away from the main party scene in Canggu, so here you're safe for a quiet hideout. Uluwatu is perched on a cliff with amazing views of the ocean, a famous temple, exiting dance shows, my favorite - private beaches. My uncle and his wife took my best friend and I to Karma Kandara and Intercontinetal in Uluwatu and it was the best experience we've ever had on a resort. I Definitely will save up and go back here :) </p>

        <h2 class="destinations__h2">Gili Trawangan</h2>
        <p class="main__descr" >Gili Trawangan was one of my favorites as well. It's one and the biggest of the three Gili Islands, Gili is also known for its outgoing vibe and in the favor of people who wants some adventure. We had to take an hour ride taxi from our villa in Canggu, then a not so pleasant boat ride for one more hour (please take some motion sickness pills beforehand) and the we finally arrived at Gili Trawangan. The island is so small the only vehicle they use there are horses and bikes, and you can circle the whole island in 30 minutes. This place is when you want to get out of the busy Bali for a weekend and just enjoy the relaxations and the perception of time that is none-existent there, except for waking up at 10 am for breakfast buffets. Best place to relax, scuba-dive, ride horses, eat and drink the best food and watch movies on the big screen on the beach at night!</p>

        <h2 class="destinations__h2">Kuta</h2>
        <p class="main__descr" >So Kuta was the traditional spot, this was the first Canggu before corona had hit the most loved place for all Australians and Dutchies. But it doesn't mean it's still not worth visiting! If you want to experience authenthic Indonesian seafood right at the beach, where locals will perform a song for you or do a traditional Balinese dance, this is the place to actually see the locals and visit the culture, that once was the place for tourism!</p>
